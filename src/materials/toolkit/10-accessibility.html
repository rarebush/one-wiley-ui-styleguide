    At Wiley, we work to meet the requirements for 'WCAG 2.0: Level AA' compliance. A full checklist of the guidelines can be found [here](http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WCAG20-20060427/appendixB.html).

    UX Architects, UI developers and UI designers all play a significant part in meeting the accessibility requirements. Here are some key points for UI designers:

    - Text or diagrams, and their background, have a luminosity contrast ratio of at least 5:1. [Click here for an online color contrast checker tool](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
    - A mechanism is available to turn off background audio that plays automatically, without requiring the user to turn off all audio.
    - Content does not blink for more than three seconds, or a method is available to stop all blinking content in the Web unit or authored component.
    - Content can be paused by the user unless the timing or movement is part of an activity where timing or movement is essential.
    - A full checklist of the guidelines can be found [here](http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-WCAG20-20060427/appendixB.html).
