    - Our primary font for online usage is Open Sans which can be found here: [Open Sans at Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans)
    - **We are currently discussing including a monospaced typeface and serif typeface to broaden the font palette for UI design only. Please check back regularly for updates.**
    - Please use 'sentence case' where possible
    - Use all caps sparingly and for key information or headings only
    - Unless specified otherwise, Wiley's corporate written language is American English

<h3>Paragraph</h3> 

<p>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>

<h3>Blockquote</h3> 

<blockquote><p>A block quotation (also known as a long quotation or extract) is a quotation in a written document, which is set off from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text, and typically distinguished visually using indentation and a different typeface or smaller size quotation.</p></blockquote>
